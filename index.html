    <h1>Beyond NEET</h1>
    <p>
        Beyond marks. Beyond exams.  
        A future doctor does not just memorize  
        they question existence.

<section>
<h2>Biology & Consciousness</h2>
<div class="reflections">

<p>37 trillion cells cooperate without ego.</p>
<p>Neurons fire, and suddenly there is thought.</p>
<p>Chemistry turns into emotion.</p>
<p>DNA writes a story older than language.</p>
<p>The heart beats without asking for motivation.</p>
<p>Cells divide and identity forms.</p>
<p>The immune system fights wars we never see.</p>
<p>Consciousness emerges from molecules.</p>
<p>A neuron alone is nothing. Together, they become you.</p>
<p>Sound is vibration becoming emotion.</p>
<p>Healing is controlled chaos.</p>
<p>Life persists against probability.</p>
<p>Oxygen fuels thought.</p>
<p>Memory reshapes neural pathways.</p>
<p>Inside us, survival is always active.</p>

</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Fragility of Life</h2>
<div class="text-block">
<p>Life is statistically improbable. Yet it persists.</p>
<p>A single clot can stop a heart. A single mutation can rewrite destiny.</p>
<p>The human body balances on thin margins electrolyte levels, oxygen saturation, blood pressure.</p>
<p>Stability is not permanent. It is maintained.</p>
<p>Medicine is not about controlling life. It is about protecting balance.</p>
<p>We call it health. Biology calls it equilibrium.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Cost of Survival</h2>
<div class="text-block">
<p>Every immune response leaves a trace.</p>
<p>Every adaptation consumes energy.</p>
<p>Every heartbeat shortens lifespan slightly.</p>
<p>Survival is expensive.</p>
<p>The body spends ATP like currency.</p>
<p>Medicine is the art of reducing biological debt.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>If I Could See Inside the Brain</h2>
<div class="text-block">
<p>If I could see thoughts forming, I would watch synapses strengthen with memory.</p>
<p>If I could see fear, I would observe adrenaline shaping perception.</p>
<p>If I could see hope, I would measure dopamine rising with belief.</p>
<p>Consciousness is invisible yet its biology is measurable.</p>
<p>That contradiction fascinates me.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Doctor I Want To Become</h2>
<div class="text-block">
<p>Not the loudest in the room. Not the most decorated.</p>
<p>But the one who understands.</p>
<p>A doctor who listens to physiology before prescribing.</p>
<p>Who sees a patient as a system not a symptom.</p>
<p>Skill matters. Awareness matters more.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The NEET Paradox</h2>
<div class="text-block">
<p>We memorize reactions. We solve numericals. We chase ranks.</p>
<p>Yet the exam tests recall while medicine demands understanding.</p>
<p>NEET is a filter. Not the destination.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Questions That Keep Me Awake</h2>
<ul>
<li>How does consciousness arise from matter?</li>
<li>Why does the body fight to survive?</li>
<li>What determines recovery speed?</li>
<li>Why do some cells become malignant?</li>
<li>How does emotion alter immunity?</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why Medicine?</h2>
<div class="text-block">
<p>I am not studying medicine just to clear an exam. NEET is only a doorway.</p>
<p>What interests me is not marks. It is the architecture of life.</p>
<p>Medicine is not just a profession. It is the study of persistence.</p>
<p>Not for status. Not for validation.</p>
<p>But because life itself is the most complex phenomenon we know and I want to understand it.</p>
